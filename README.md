## About the App

It's a simple 4 page application for task management. SignUp, Login, Home and Ai suggestion page. Here user can add tasks, edit tasks, complete them and delete them. Users need to give task tile, description, priority 1 (most urgent) - 10 (least urgent) and a deadline before which they want to complete the task.

On AI suggestion page user can get suggestions on how to prioritize his/her tasks and AI would also create sub tasks for the user.
